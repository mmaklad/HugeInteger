# HugeInteger
This is a Java Class that I created to mimic the function of Java's BigInteger Class.

This class was created as a lab for my Data Structures and Algorithms Course. The idea of the class is to create a data type that can store an integer of infinite digits and be able to preform basic operations with it.
